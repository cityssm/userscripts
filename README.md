# City of Sault Ste. Marie Userscripts

Web browser userscripts to help with common irks in our applications.

Scripts are tested in the [Violentmonkey browser extension](https://violentmonkey.github.io/),
available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and others.

They will likely work with other userscript extensions, like Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, and Firemonkey.
